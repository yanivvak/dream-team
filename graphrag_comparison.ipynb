He is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$191 billion as of April 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $182.6 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.\\n\\n\\n== Details ==\\nAt the start of 2020, Elon Musk had a net worth of $27 billion. By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock. During this period, Musk\\'s net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index\\'s history at the time. In November of that year, Musk passed Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the second-richest.\\nIn January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world. Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month. On September 27, 2021, after Tesla stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 billion, and was the richest person in the world. In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion.\\nOn December 30, 2022, it was reported that Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth due to declining stock values in Tesla, becoming the first person in history to lose such a large sum of money. In January 2023, Musk was recognized by Guinness World Records for experiencing the \"largest loss of personal fortune in history\" with regards to his financial losses since November 2021, which Guinness quoted a Forbes estimate of $182 billion.\\nMusk\\'s personal wealth is managed by his family office called Excession LLC, formed in 2016 and run by Jared Birchall.\\n\\n\\n=== Sources of wealth ===\\nAround 75% of Musk\\'s wealth was derived from Tesla stock in November 2020, a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022, after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021. Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla\\'s valuation and revenue. The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values. It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board. In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.\\nThe above stock compensation deal was invalidated by the Delaware court due to Musk controlling Tesla and having massive influence on the directors, making the compensation decision a \"conflicted-controller transaction\" which is subject to court review in Delaware law to be judged for fairness. Tesla is trying to reinstate the payment package via new shareholders votes.\\nMusk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018. According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018. He stated his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.\\nMusk has repeatedly described himself as \"cash poor\", and has \"professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth\".

The four-part proposal, posted as a Twitter poll, suggested new referendums under United Nations supervision on the annexation of Russia-occupied territories. The proposal was welcomed by the Russian government and denounced by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"pro-Russia\", with officials noting that people who had been murdered or forcibly deported by Russia would be unable to vote.\\nMusk appeared to be \"transmitting a message\" for Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to foreign affairs specialist Fiona Hill.

Musk previously made a similar suggestion at a September event in Aspen, Colorado. Hill told Politico, \"Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role. But in reality, they\\'re just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin\".\\nIn an email newsletter, Ian Bremmer, head of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, said that Musk told him that he had spoken directly with Putin, which Musk denied in a reply on Twitter. Musk claimed he had spoken to Putin only once 18 months prior, on a space-related subject matter.

In response to allegations, X Corp. has pursued legal action against nonprofit organizations Media Matters and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Acquisition of Twitter ===\\n\\nElon Musk initiated the acquisition of Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and completed it on October 28, 2022. His goal was to transform Twitter into X, an all-encompassing app inspired by WeChat. By April, Musk had become Twitter\\'s largest shareholder with a 9.2 percent stake and made an unsolicited $44 billion offer on April 14, which Twitter\\'s board initially resisted before accepting on April 25. In July, Musk attempted to terminate the deal, citing Twitter\\'s failure to address spam bot accounts. Twitter sued him, with a trial set for mid-October. Musk then reversed his decision and completed the acquisition on October 28. He became the new owner and CEO, took Twitter private, merged it into X Corp., and fired several top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal. Following Twitter\\'s change in ownership, Musk renamed several features to remove references to bird-oriented terminology, including Birdwatch to Community Notes.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-acquisition ===\\nOn July 23, 2023, Musk announced X\\'s launch, which would replace Twitter, which started when the X.com domain (formerly associated with PayPal) began redirecting to Twitter; the logo was changed from the bird to the X the next day, and the platform\\'s official main and associated accounts also began using the letter X within their handles. The @x handle was originally owned by photographer Gene X Hwang, who registered it in 2007. Hwang had expressed willingness to sell the handle, but received an email on July 25, 2023, stating that the company was taking it. He was offered some X merchandise and a meeting with the company\\'s leaders, but no financial benefits. The Android app\\'s name and icon were changed to X on Google Play by July 27; the same change went live on the App Store on July 31 after Apple granted an exception to its minimum character length of 2. Around that time, some more elements of the Twitter branding were removed from the web version, including tweets being renamed to \"posts\".\\nThe rebrand was described as unusual, given that Twitter\\'s brand was already strong internationally, with words like \"tweet\" having entered common language.

Musk stated he intended to buy Twitter to build X, an \"everything app\" he had been developing since 2018 to mimic the Chinese app WeChat. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter\\'s board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk\\'s buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.\\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter\\'s new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. \\nMusk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company\\'s workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk\\'s planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk\\'s intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions, including the December 2022 suspensions of ten journalists.\\n\\n\\n== Prelude ==\\n\\n\\n=== Background ===\\n\\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk published his first tweet on his personal Twitter account in June 2010, and had more than 80 million followers by April 2022. In 2017, in response to a tweet suggesting that he buy Twitter, Inc., Musk replied, \"How much is it?\" On March 24, 2022, Musk began tweeting criticisms of Twitter, polling his followers on whether the company adhered to the principle that \"free speech is essential to a functioning democracy\". Days later, he discussed the future of social media with Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey and explored the possibility of joining Twitter\\'s board of directors with private equity firm Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban. He relayed this idea to Twitter board chair Bret Taylor and CEO Parag Agrawal, proposing to either take the company private or start a rival social media platform.

Musk stated he intended to buy Twitter to build X, an \"everything app\" he had been developing since 2018 to mimic the Chinese app WeChat. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter\\'s board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk\\'s buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech.\\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter\\'s new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. \\nMusk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company\\'s workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk\\'s planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk\\'s intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions, including the December 2022 suspensions of ten journalists.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk'}), Document(page_content='Maye Musk (née Haldeman; born April 19, 1948) is a model and dietitian.

Her family moved to Pretoria, South Africa, in 1950. Her parents, Winnifred Josephine \"Wyn\" (Fletcher) and Dr. Joshua Norman Haldeman, a former director of Technocracy Incorporated, a former Regina chiropractor and amateur archaeologist, were adventurous and flew the family around the world in a prop plane in 1952. For over ten years, the family spent time roaming the Kalahari desert in search of its fabled Lost City of the Kalahari. Their parents gave slide shows and talks about their journeys. \"My parents were very famous, but they were never snobs,\" she said. Joshua Haldeman was a political activist who ran for the Canadian Parliament on the Social Credit Party ticket, and headed the Canadian branch of the Technocracy movement. In 1956 Dr. Haldeman participated on the 3rd edition of the trans-Africa Algiers-Cape Town Rally with a Ford Ranch-Wagon 5.4L and finished tied for 1st place.\\nAs her parents were entrepreneurs, Musk started working at about 8 years of age, where she would \"prepare her parents monthly bulletins and photocopy newsletters, and then put the stamps on the envelopes.” By the age of 12, before and then after school, Musk worked as a receptionist alongside her twin sister for their father. \\nAs a young woman, Haldeman was a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa beauty competition. In 1970, she married Errol Musk, a South African engineer she met in high school. They had three children: Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, and Tosca Musk.

The book was written by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN, TIME and the Aspen Institute who had previously written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci. The book was published on September 12, 2023, by Simon & Schuster.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nElon Musk first announced that Isaacson was in the process of writing his biography in August 2021. He revealed that Isaacson had shadowed him \"for several days so far\".\\nIsaacson followed Musk for the next two years, visiting his SpaceX and Tesla factories and attending board meetings. The book is the result of hours of interviews with Musk and his family, friends, colleagues and adversaries. Isaacson was present when Musk decided to buy Twitter and to run his new AI company; Musk also shared messages from the Ukrainian minister Mykhailo Fedorov, and some were included in the book. Isaacson later said in an interview that \"Elon is very mercurial, but he never told me not to put anything in the book.\"\\n\\n\\n== Contents ==\\nIsaacson writes that Musk is \"addicted to drama\".\\n\\n\\n=== Crimean Starlink coverage deactivation claim ===\\n\\nAmong the book\\'s revelations was an account that Musk ordered Starlink to disable access to Ukrainian drones in 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, thwarting an attack on Russian warships in Crimea. Musk denied the allegation, saying satellites in the region were not turned on, and that he chose not to activate them. The biography claim prompted several allegations against Musk for deliberately disrupting the operation. Isaacson later retracted his claim as a mistake, as Crimea had no Starlink coverage prior to the attack similarly to other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. \\nThe Washington Post, which had published Isaacson\\'s opinion piece, corrected that \"after the publication of this adaptation, the author learned that his book mischaracterized the attempted attack by Ukrainian drones on the Russian fleet in Crimea. Musk had already disabled (\"geofenced\") coverage within 100 km of the Crimean coast before the attack began, and when the Ukrainians discovered this, they asked him to activate the coverage, and he refused.\" The Guardian and CNN also added a footnote to correct the claim.\\nIsaacson corrected his claim and clarified that Elon Musk said that the policy to not allow Starlink to be used for an attack on Crimea had been implemented earlier than the night of the Ukrainian attack, while Ukrainians did not know about it. Ukrainian general Kyrylo Budanov declared being \"not sure that Elon Musk operated some mythical buttons and stopped the movement of some devices. This is my personal opinion. The fact that the Starlink systems did not work for a certain time near the Crimea, I can absolutely confirm, because we also used a certain technique. We immediately realized that there is simply no coverage there\".\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nAhead of its publication, the book topped Amazon\\'s bestseller list. It debuted at number one on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list for the week ending September 16, 2023.\\nAt the review aggregator website Book Marks, the book had an overall rating of \"mixed\", based on 15 book reviews from mainstream literary critics. \\nThe New York Times critic Jennifer Szalai wrote, \"Isaacson [...] is a patient chronicler of obsession; in the case of Musk, he can occasionally seem too patient.\"\\nBrian Merchant of the Los Angeles Times criticized Isaacson\\'s \"great man\" biography format as extremely dated and took issue with his persistent framing of Musk as a \"moody but brilliant world-mover\", writing, \"The author will unearth unflattering personal anecdotes and share stories about the subject\\'s capacity to be cruel.

The group of initial hires consisted of experts in areas such as neuroscience, biochemistry and robotics. The trademark \"Neuralink\" was purchased from its previous owners in January 2017.\\nIn April 2017, Neuralink announced that it was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism. Musk had said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science fiction concept of \"neural lace\" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by Iain M. Banks.\\nMusk defined the neural lace as a \"digital layer above the cortex\" that would not necessarily imply extensive surgical insertion but ideally an implant through a vein or artery. He said the long-term goal is to achieve \"symbiosis with artificial intelligence\", which he perceives as an existential threat to humanity if it goes unchecked. He believes the device will be \"something analogous to a video game, like a saved game situation, where you are able to resume and upload your last state\" and \"address brain injuries or spinal injuries and make up for whatever lost capacity somebody has with a chip.\"\\nAs of 2020, Neuralink was headquartered in San Francisco\\'s Mission District, sharing the Pioneer building with OpenAI, another company co-founded by Musk.\\nAs of 2022, Neuralink\\'s headquarters were in Fremont, California. Jared Birchall, the head of Musk\\'s family office, was listed as CEO, CFO and president of Neuralink in 2018. As of September 2018, Musk was the majority owner of Neuralink but did not hold an executive position. By August 2020, only three of the eight founding scientists remained at the company, according to an article by Stat News which reported that Neuralink had seen \"years of internal conflict in which rushed timelines have clashed with the slow and incremental pace of science.\"\\nIn April 2021, Neuralink demonstrated a monkey playing the game \"Pong\" using the Neuralink implant. While similar technology has existed since 2002, when a research group first demonstrated a monkey moving a computer cursor with neural signals, scientists acknowledged the engineering progress in making the implant wireless and increasing the number of implanted electrodes. In May 2021, co-founder and president Max Hodak announced that he no longer works with the company.

He offered to pay Sweeney $5,000; Sweeney countered requesting $50,000 or an internship in one of Musk\\'s companies, and offered advice on restricting flight tracking data. Musk blocked Sweeney in January 2021. In late 2022, after Musk purchased Twitter, he announced he would not ban the ElonJet account. In December, a stalker followed Elon\\'s 2-year-old son while he was traveling in a car; the stalker thought Musk was in the car. After the incident, the account was restricted and then blocked along with Sweeney\\'s personal and other flight tracking accounts, as part of the December 2022 Twitter account suspensions. Later, shortly after the incident, accounts of several journalists were reinstated.\\nOn December 22, 2022, Sweeney started the new @ElonJetNextDay Twitter account, which continues to track the flights of Elon Musk\\'s private jets, but publishes flight location information on a 24-hour delay in compliance with Twitter\\'s new rules that \"sharing publicly available location information after a reasonable time has elapsed, so that the individual is no longer at risk for physical harm\" is not a violation.\\n\\n\\n== Function ==\\nThe ElonJet service uses publicly available flight data as well as an automated computer program, a Twitter bot, to report Elon Musk\\'s flights. The service uses ADS-B data, publicly available records, to give general information about where and when Musk\\'s private jet was taking off and landing, though it cannot indicate who is on board or where the passengers travel before or after the flight. The Twitter account in particular became a reliable way for Musk\\'s investors, fans, and critics to determine his whereabouts, often between the Austin area where he lives, the San Francisco Bay area where Tesla\\'s factory is, and Southern California, where SpaceX is headquartered.\\nAs of July 2023, the ElonJet service is hosted on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Threads, Mastodon, and Bluesky accounts. The Mastodon account was created on December 14, 2022, a day after the original Twitter account was suspended. Sweeney has earned a few thousand dollars with the accounts, via ad revenue, allowing him to upgrade his computer. A subreddit dedicated to the service, r/ElonJetTracker, gained over 40,000 members in the two days since it was created on December 14, becoming one of the fastest-growing subreddits on the website.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe ElonJet Twitter account was started in June 2020 by Florida student Jack Sweeney. At the time, he was a high school senior, with his education suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Sweeney considered himself a fan of Musk\\'s work at SpaceX and Tesla, leading him to start the account.\\nElon Musk has had issues with the account for a long time, and offered Jack Sweeney $5,000 to delete the account in 2021. Sweeney countered asking for $50,000, saying he would use the money for college and possibly to buy a Tesla Model 3. Their last exchange was in January 2022, when Musk said it wouldn\\'t feel right to pay in order to shut the account down. Sweeney asked about the possibility of an internship at one of Musk\\'s companies, and offered Musk advice, including about a federal privacy program to vary the ID his transponder beamed out, thus blocking flight tracking programs. Musk began using the program, though Sweeney remained able to track Musk\\'s flights. Musk blocked Sweeney sometime after January 23.\\n\\nMusk purchased Twitter in October 2022, and announced early in t', metadata={'title': 'ElonJet', 'summary': 'ElonJet is a service that uses social media accounts to track the real-time private airplane usage of Elon Musk.

Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. Work on the project started in February 2006. Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m. PST (UTC−08:00): \"just setting up my twttr\". The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees. The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter\\'s startup until 2011. Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.\\nThe tipping point for Twitter\\'s popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. \"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\" remarked Newsweek\\'s Steven Levy. \"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\" Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was \"absolutely ruling\" SXSWi. Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter was \"owning\" the conference.\\n\\n\\n=== 2007–2022: Growth ===\\nIn April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies. Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin. Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users.\\nThe company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on November 7, 2013.\\nIn September 2016, Twitter shares rose 20% after a report that it had received takeover approaches.

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",
    "- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "{'- **Allowed Node Labels:**' + \", \".join(allowed_nodes) if allowed_nodes else \"\"}\n",
    "{'- **Allowed Relationship Types**:' + \", \".join(allowed_rels) if allowed_rels else \"\"}\n",
    "## 3. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "- Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "- **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "- **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "- **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "## 4. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency, and not duplicate entities.\n",
    "If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"), \n",
    "always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.  \n",
    "Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial. \n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

The deal stipulated that Musk only received the compensation if Tesla reached certain market values. It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.
